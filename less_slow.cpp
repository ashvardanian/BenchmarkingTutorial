/**
 *  Using Google Benchmark is simple. You define a C++ function, and then you register it
 *  with provided C macros. The suite will invoke your function, passing a `State` object,
 *  that dynamically chooses the number of loops to run based on the time it takes to execute
 *  each cycle.
 *
 *  For simplicity, let's start by benchmarking the most basic operation - 32-bit integer addition,
 *  universally natively supported by every modern CPU, be it x86, ARM, or RISC-V, 32-bit or 64-bit,
 *  big-endian or little-endian.

/**
 *  Trivial kernels operating on constant values are not the easiest candidates for benchmarking.
 *  The compiler can easily optimize them out, and the CPU can predict the result... showing "0 ns",
 *  zero nanoseconds per iteration.
 *
 *  Unfortunately, no operation runs this fast on the computer. On a 3 GHz CPU, you would perform
 *  3 Billion ops every second. So, each would take 0.33 ns, not 0 ns. If we change the compilation
 *  settings discarding the @b `-O3` flag for "Release build" optimizations, we may see a non-zero value,
 *  but it won't be representative of the real-world performance.
 *
 *  Another thing we can try - is generating random inputs on the fly with @b `std::rand()`, one of the
 *  most controversial operations in the C standard library.

 *
 *  The answer is - no, it's not. The addition itself takes a single CPU cycle, and it's very fast.
 *  Chances are we just benchmarked something else... the `std::rand()` function.
 *
 *? Fun fact: there are only a couple of integer operations that can take ~100 cycles on select AMD CPUs,
 *? like the BMI2 bit-manipulation instructions, like @b `pdep` and @b `pext`, on AMD Zen 1 and Zen 2 chips.
 *? https://www.chessprogramming.org/BMI2

 *

 *  where a single global state is shared between all threads. It's a performance @b killer.

 *  Knowing, that the `std::sort` algorithm is based on Quick-Sort, we can reverse the array on each iteration,
 *  which is a well known worst-case scenario for that family of algorithms.
 *
 *  We can also parameterize the benchmark with runtime values, like the size of the array and whether to include
 *  the preprocessing step. This is done with the `Args` function.

// The `if` statement and seemingly innocent ternary operator (condition ? a : b)
// can have a high for performance. It's especially noticeable, when conditional
// execution is happening at the scale of single bytes, like in text processing,
// parsing, search, compression, encoding, and so on.
//
// The CPU has a branch-predictor which is one of the most complex parts of the silicon.
// It memorizes the most common `if` statements, to allow "speculative execution".
// In other words, start processing the task (i + 1), before finishing the task (i).
//
// Those branch predictors are very powerful, and if you have a single `if` statement
// on your hot-path, it's not a big deal. But most programs are almost entirely built
// on `if` statements. On most modern CPUs up to 4096 branches will be memorized, but
// anything that goes beyond that, would work slower - 2.9 ns vs 0.7 ns for the following snippet.
